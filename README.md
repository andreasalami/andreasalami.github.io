# 🌐 HTML-CSS-Project

## 👋 About

Welcome to my first personal website! Here you can find:

- 👤 **A short BIO**: Where I present myself
- 💻 **My coding skills**: Discover the technologies I know
- 🎗 **Two sections about volunteering and passions**: Sharing my efforts and interests

🌐 From here you can access my CV and my social network links like LinkedIn, GitHub, and X.

📬 There's also a simple form if you want to reach me with a message.

This website was created using only HTML and CSS to meet the assignment requirements, but this is only the first step. Over time, I will surely update this project to better match my style and add new features!
